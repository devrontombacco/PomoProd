# PomoProd

This app is a Pomodoro timer that will help you be more productive as it narrows your focus down to short bursts, usually a maximum of 25 minutes each, with a short 5 minute break in between. It is common practise after two or three pomodoros to then take a longer break 10-15 minute break before starting a new series of pomodoros. Studies show that these short concentrated bursts are far more effective in the long run compared with long 2-3 hour focus sessions.

I thought that a mobile app providing this functionality would be perfect given that people can prop their phone up at their desks while focusing on the task at hand.

## Technologies Used
- Created using Swift 5 and UIKit
- I usually code programmatically but decided to use Storyboards this time around.
- This was a fun little app to build and proved to be good practise for timers, segues and general UI Layout.

## Design
- I came up with the UI all by myself, using AdobeXD for the Mock Up.
- I decided to use a cooler color scheme to promote a relaxed, calming feel to the interface given that the app does not need to constantly retain the user's attention with flashy lights or sounds. It is intended to encourage mental focus on the task at hand.
- I went with a light background and a highlighted label on the main screen so that with a quick glance the user can see how much time is remaining in their pomodoro. I specifically wanted to get rid of all superfluous information from the main screen.

## Setup
