# PomoProd

This app is a Pomodoro timer that will help you be more productive, as it narrows your focus down to 25 minute bursts (or sprints) with a 5 minute break in between. Usually after two or three pomodors with a short break, the user should take a long break before starting a new series of pomodors. Studies show that these short concentrated bursts are far more effective in being productive compared with long 2-3 hour stints.

I thought that a mobile app providing this functionality would be perfect given that people can prop their phone up at their desks while focusing on the task at hand. 

## Technologies Used
- Created using Swift 5 and UIKit
- Given that its a small app I decided to use Storyboards for speed, as opposed to doing the UI programmatically.
- All development was done in XCode on a MacBook Pro

## Design
- I designed, did the mockup and prototyped the entire app myself in Adobe XD 
- The ended up using this soft blue color palette, but only after trying three different color palettes first. 

## SETUP 
To run this project, just clone it to your desktop and run it in Xcode. Any feedback is welcome!
